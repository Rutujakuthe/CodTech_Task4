```

=== TECHNICAL FEATURES DEMONSTRATED ===

✅ **HTTP Client Implementation:**
- Java 11+ HttpClient for secure HTTP GET requests
- Configurable timeout settings (5s connection, 10s request)
- Proper request header management with Accept: application/json
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Cross-platform network compatibility

✅ **JSON Response Processing:**
- Custom JSON parsing without external dependencies
- Pure Java string manipulation and data extraction algorithms
- Nested object parsing for complex data structures
- Efficient memory usage for large JSON responses
- Error-tolerant parsing with fallback mechanisms

✅ **Structured Data Display:**
- User-friendly formatted output with clear categorization
- Professional console formatting for enhanced readability
- Hierarchical data presentation (User → Address → Company)
- Clean separation of different data categories
- Consistent formatting across all output sections

✅ **Error Handling and Fallback Systems:**
- Comprehensive network failure handling
- API timeout and connection error management
- JSON parsing error recovery with detailed reporting
- Fallback demo data for offline functionality
- Graceful degradation ensuring application reliability

✅ **Network Configuration Management:**
- Proxy configuration support for corporate environments
- Firewall restriction handling and bypass mechanisms
- Connection timeout management for unreliable networks
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- SSL/TLS support for secure HTTPS connections

=== API INTEGRATION DETAILS ===

**API Endpoint:** https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
**HTTP Method:** GET
**Response Format:** JSON
**Authentication:** None required (public API)
**Rate Limiting:** No restrictions for testing

**Request Headers:**
- Accept: application/json
- User-Agent: Java HttpClient
- Connection: keep-alive

**Response Analysis:**
- Status Code: 200 OK
- Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
- Response Time: ~200-500ms (depending on network)
- Data Size: ~500 bytes (compressed JSON)

=== CUSTOM JSON PARSING ALGORITHM ===

**Key Extraction Method:**
```
1. Locate key pattern: "keyName":
2. Find value start position after colon
3. Determine value type (string, number, object)
4. Extract value based on delimiters
5. Handle nested objects recursively
6. Return parsed value or "N/A" for missing data
```

**Nested Object Parsing:**
```
1. Find parent object key pattern
2. Locate opening brace for nested object
3. Count braces to find matching closing brace
4. Extract nested object substring
5. Apply key extraction to nested content
6. Return nested value or handle parsing errors
```

=== FALLBACK DEMO DATA SYSTEM ===

**When API is Unavailable:**
```
